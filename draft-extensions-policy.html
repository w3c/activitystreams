    <h1 id="title">Process for Including Extensions in Activity Streams 2.0</h1>
    <section id='abstract'>
      <p>
        This document describes the process and criteria for approving extensions
        for inclusion in the main Activity Streams 2.0 context document.
      </p>
    </section>

        This is a draft Note for publication by the SocialCG. It is not a W3C
        recommendation.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Activity Streams 2.0, as described in [[activitystreams-core]]
        and [[activitystreams-vocabulary]] is a vocabulary for representing
        social data. It is used by, among others, the [[activitypub]] API and protocol.
        It is designed to be extensible, so that new terms can
        be used by publishers and consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
          Extensions provide at least the following benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Support specialist vocabularies for specific fields of interest</li>
          <li>Model social software patterns that were not common when
              Activity Streams 2.0 was originally published</li>
          <li>Provide alternate terms or structures for patterns already
              represented in Activity Streams 2.0 that improve the vocabulary's clarity
              or ease of use</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Any publisher can define an extension to Activity Streams 2.0, and use it in
          published documents. For example, a publisher could define an extension
          that provides a term for the favorite ice cream flavor of a person.

      <p>
          This publisher, or any other publisher, can create Activity Streams 2.0
          documents that use this extension.
      </p>

            <pre class="example highlight json">
              {
                  "@context": [
                      "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
                      "https://favorites.example/ns/icecream"
                  ],
                  "id": "https://example.com/people/evan",
                  "type": "Person",
                  "name": "Evan Prodromou",
                  "favoriteIceCreamFlavor": "Pistachio"
              }
            </pre>

      <p>
          If the publisher uses different extensions in the same
          document with different terms, they will need to resolve
          those naming conflicts by hand.
      </p>
      <figure>
          <figcaption>

          <div id="ex1-context" style="display: block;">
            <pre class="example highlight json">
              {
                  "@context": [
                      "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
                      "https://favorites.example/ns/icecream",
                      "https://horse.example/ns/colors"
                  ],
                  "id": "https://example.com/people/evan",
                  "type": "Person",
                  "name": "Evan Prodromou",
                  "favoriteIceCreamFlavor": "ic:Chocolate",
                  "horseCoatColor": "horse:Chocolate"
              }
            </pre>
          </div>
      </figure>
      <p>
          Any publisher or consumer can implement this extension, subject to
          the terms of the creator's license(s), if any.
      </p>
      <p>
          Referencing many extensions can be a burden for publishers and consumers.
          Although one or two lines in the @context property of the Activity Streams 2.0
          document may not be a problem, ten or twenty could be. In addition,
          the more extensions that are used, the more likely it is that there will
          be conflicts between terms.
      </p>
      <p>
          If an extension becomes very popular, it may be useful to include its terms
          and namespace in the main Activity Streams 2.0 context document.
          This will let publishers use the extension without having to include
          an additional line of context. It also provides an opportunity to resolve
          conflicts between terms in different extensions in the SocialCG.
      </p>
      <p>
          Thereafter, publishers will not need to include the extension's context URL
          in their documents. The extension's terms will be available for all documents
          that use the Activity Streams 2.0 context, without requiring a namespace
          prefix.
      </p>
      <figure>
          <figcaption>
              Theoretical example of using the favorite ice cream flavor term
              after it has been included in the main Activity Streams 2.0 context
              document.
          </figcaption>
          <div id="ex1-context" style="display: block;">
            <pre class="example highlight json">
              {
                  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
                  "id": "https://example.com/people/evan",
                  "type": "Person",
                  "name": "Evan Prodromou",
                  "favoriteIceCreamFlavor": "Chocolate"
              }
            </pre>
          </div>
      </figure>
      <p>
          This inclusion does not come without a price. First, the Activity Streams 2.0
          context document is that much larger, which has a cost in terms of readability,
          maintainability, and bandwidth used. In addition, there is work for the
          SocialCG in updating, documenting, harmonizing, and maintaining the context
          document.
      </p>
      <p>
          This Note describes the criteria that the SocialCG will use to decide
          whether the benefits of simplicity and clarity by including extension
          terms in the main context document outweigh the costs of doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
          Properly implemented, this process provides a way to make Activity Streams 2.0
          a continuously evolving vocabulary, serving new needs for developers and
          users, while maintaining the stability of the core terms.

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>These are the steps to including an extension in
          the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Publish the extension for review.</b> Extensions can be published
          through the Federation Enhancement Proposal (FEP) process, as Notes of
          the SocialCG, through another standardisation process, or by any other
          organisations or individuals. See "Criteria" below for required content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Implement the extension.</b> See "Criteria" below for implementation requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>List the extension in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Activity_Streams_extensions">Activity Streams 2.0 extensions registry</a>.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Propose the extension for inclusion.</b> The proposal should include a justification
          for inclusion of the extension.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Vote on the extension.</b> The SocialCG will vote on whether to include the
          extension in the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Create a draft version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document including
          the extension terms and namespace.</b> This is the time to resolve any conflicts
          with existing names in the context document.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Test the draft version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Publish the new version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Criteria</h2>
      <p>To be included in the Activity Streams 2.0, extensions SHOULD meet these requirements.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              A unique namespace, distinct from the Activity Streams 2.0 namespace.
          </li>
          <li>
              A JSON-LD context document at a permanent URL.
          </li>
          <li>A document that describes the terms and usage of the extension.</li>
          <li>
              An intellectual property rights policy that is compatible with
              inclusion in a W3C specification.
          </li>
          <li>
              Demonstrated implementation by at least two (2) independent publishers.
          </li>
          <li>
              Demonstrated implementation by at least two (2) independent consumers.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Extensions to be included MAY meet these criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A security review, either by the submitter, members of the SocialCG, or by the [SecurityIG](https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/IG/W3C_spec_review).
        </li>
        <li>
          A privacy review, either by the submitter, members of the SocialCG, or others.
        </li>
        <li>
          An accessibility (A11Y) review.
        </li>
        <li>
          An internationalisation (I18N) review.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Previous Work</h2>
      <p>
        The section on Extensibility in [[activitystreams-core]] says, in part,
        "Some popular extensions are included in the Activity Streams 2.0 namespace
        document [...]". It does not define how extensions are added and which
        criteria are used to decide whether an extension is popular enough to be
        included.

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#extensions">The section on Extensions in the Activity Streams 2.0 namespace document</a>
        says, in part, "The extensions must document their terms in a spec-like way
        at a persistant [sic] URL. Approval of extensions will be by the Social Web WG
        until it closes, and after that by the followup Community Group. Process and criteria
        for extensions approval is being finalised and will be described or linked
        to here in due course."
